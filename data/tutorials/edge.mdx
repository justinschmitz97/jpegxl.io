## JPEG XL Tutorial

Enabling JPEG XL in Microsoft Edge 91 is tricky. The runtime flag has to be embedded in a shortcut and may not work all the time (e.g. if you run Edge from a different shortcut without runtime flag). Here's how you can enable it permanently... or at least until you revert it.

Enabling JPEG XL in Microsoft Edge 91 is tricky. The runtime flag has to be embedded in a shortcut and may not work all the time (e.g. if you run Edge from a different shortcut without runtime flag). Here's how you can enable it permanently... or at least until you revert it.

## Enable via shortcut:

You just have to add a command line flag to the end of the target field in the properties of the shortcut:
--enable-features=JXL

## Enable permanently

1. MAKE SURE THAT THE BROWSER ISN'T RUNNING.
2. Open %localappdata%\Microsoft\Edge\User Data in File Explorer.
3. Open Local State file in your favourite text editor.
4. Find "enabled_labs_experiments": string.
   If you found it, enter "enable-jxl@1" inside empty brackets next to the string above.
   If the brackets aren't empty because you've already got some flags enabled, insert ,"enable-jxl@1" (yes, with that comma) before the closing bracket, after all other flag descriptions (or inside the list, I tried to keep its alphabetical order).
   If you couldn't find that string, add "enabled_labs_experiments":["enable-jxl@1"], right after "browser_version_of_last_seen_whats_new":"xxxxxxx",
5. Save and close the file, then open the browser and test if JPEG XL is workingon
