## What is JPEG XL?

## What is nomacs?

Nomacs is an open-source image viewer that supports a variety of platforms. It is capable of displaying all standard image formats, including RAW and PSD images. A significant feature of Nomacs is the semi-transparent widgets that display additional information, such as thumbnails, metadata, and histograms. The program can browse photos in zip files or MS Office files extracted to a directory. You can display metadata associated with the image, as well as add notes to the picture. In addition, a thumbnail preview of the current folder is provided, as well as a panel that can be used to switch between folders. It is possible to apply a file filter to a directory so that only images whose filenames contain a specific string or match a regular expression will be displayed. By activating the cache, you can switch between images instantly. The Nomacs program includes methods for adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, and exposure of images. The program consists of a pseudo-color function that enables false color images to be generated. Nomacs is unique in its capability to synchronize multiple instances. Using this feature, you can easily compare photos by zooming or panning at precisely the same position or overlaying them with different opacities.
