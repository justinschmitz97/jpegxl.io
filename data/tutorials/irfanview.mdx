## What is IrfanView?

IrfanView is a free program for Windowsallows the user to view, edit, organize, and convert images. It is a small, fast, and easy-to-use programcan handle a wide variety of graphic formats. Furthermore, it is capable of creating and painting pictures as well as playing video and audio files. A free version of IrfanView is available for non-commercial use, whereas a registered version is available for commercial use. It was first released in 1996.

## IrfanView JXL Support

A new evaluation copy of IrfanView has recently been released by the developer, which includes JXL support. A Reddit user, Jaystarx, has been in touch with the developer and provided a link to the version on the JPEG XL subreddit. Upon consultation with the developer, he made the version available for experienced JXL users to test Irfanview's compatibility to ensureit works correctly before the official release.

## IrfanView JXL Tutorial

Download the preview with the link below
Unzip the content directly into the common IrfanView folder
Overwrite any files in the process
Make sure the JXL plugin is activated (Help>Installed plugins> JPEG_XL.DLL)

The files can then be read and saved as JXL. The basic JXL settings (Save Quality and Speed Effort) can then be adjusted, and a checkbox option is provided to save the JXL as a Progressive JXL.
