## What is Cloudinary?

Cloudinary is a cloud computing company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with offices in Israel, England, Poland, and Singapore. The firm offers cloud-based services for managing images and videos. With it, users can upload, store, manage, manipulate, and deliver images and videos for use in websites and apps. More than 1 million web and mobile application developers use Cloudinary, including Cond√© Nast, Dropbox, Forbes, Outbrain, Taboola, and Answers.com. Cloudinary has been hailed as the "gold standard" of image management on the web by Inc Magazine. Cloudinary offers a free plan for life without requiring a credit card. Credits are used to track your usage, with the free plan providing 25 credits. Either you can use them to purchase 25k transformations, 25GB of managed storage, or 25GB of bandwidth for net viewing. Additionally, they offer video transformation, API access, auto backups, and video revision tracking. In addition to more conversions, backups to your S3 bucket, auto-tagging-based search, and access to a wide range of add-ons (e.g., background removing), more advanced pricing plans are also available.
