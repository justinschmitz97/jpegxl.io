## What is ImageMagick?

You can use ImageMagick to create, edit, compose or convert digital images. It supports a wide range of image formats (over 200), including PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, HEIC, SVG, PDF, DPX, EXR, and TIFF. Images can be resized, flipped, mirrored, rotated, deformed, sheared, and transformed using ImageMagick. They can also be adjusted for colors, applied with various effects, or be made into lines, polygons, ellipses, or text. You may use, copy, modify, and distribute ImageMagick in both open-source and proprietary applications. ImageMagick is available either ready-to-run binary distribution or source code that you may use, copy, modify, and distribute. The software is distributed under a license derived from Apache 2.0. ImageMagick utilizes multiple computational threads to increase performance. It can read, process, and write images up to mega-, giga-, or terabytes in size.

## ImageMagick JXL support

Since version 7.0.10-54, ImageMagick supports JPEG XL. You can utilize the format as you would with any other image codec.
