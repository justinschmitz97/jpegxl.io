## What is PHP?

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting languageis particularly well suited for web development and embedded within HTML. Rather than using lots of commands to output HTML (as with C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded codeaccomplishes a task (in this case, "Hello, I'm a PHP script! "). It is important to notePHP differs from client-side JavaScript inthe code is executed on the server, which generates HTML, which is then sent to the client. Although the client would receive the results of runningscript, they would not know the underlying code. In addition, you can configure your webserver to process all your HTML files using PHP, so your users will be unable to discover what you are doing behind the scenes. There are several advantages to using PHP, includingit is straightforward to use for a newcomer but offers a range of advanced features for professional programmers.

## PHP JXL support

PHP has recently added support for AVIF in version 8.1. To this date, no native PHP support is available.
Luckily, Johannes Siipola has created a PHP library for encoding JPEG XL images. It requires PHP 7.2.5 or later and works under Linux, macOS, or Windows OS with x64 architecture.
