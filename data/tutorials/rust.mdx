## What is Rust?

As a fast and memory-efficient language, Rust does not require a runtime or garbage collector, so it can be used to run embedded devices, power performance-critical web services, and easily integrate with other languages. Rust's rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory safety and thread safety, enabling you to eliminate many categories of bugs before they are compiled. There is excellent documentation, an excellent compiler with helpful error messages, and top-quality tooling - an integrated package manager and build tool, superb support for multi-editors with auto-completion and type inspection, as well as an auto-formatter.

## Rust JXL support

The crate JPEGXL_RS offers a safe JPEGXL wrapper over the jpeg-xl library, based on the official libjxl.
