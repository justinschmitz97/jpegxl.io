## What is The Lounge?

Developed for self-hosting, The Lounge is a modern web interface for IRC. A variety of new features bring IRC into the 21st century, including push notifications, link previews, and message markers. The Node.js server runs on any OS, so it does not matter what operating system you use. It is compatible with desktop, smartphone, and tablet computers. You can continue where you left off regardless of the device you are using. Open source and licensed under the MIT license, the Lounge can be accessed by anyone worldwide.

## The Lounge JXL support

As of now (26.10.21), preview images are displayed for WebP and AVIF, but not JPEG XL. JPEG XL Preview support is being shipped in the upcoming 4.3.0 milestone at an unknown date.
