## Why Apple takes so long

**Safari does not support AVIF because Apple has not added AVIF support to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.**

Apple took a decade to add support for WebP. As Safari is one of the most popular browsers, its refusal to add support has delayed the adoption of the format as a whole. Developers were unable to use this format on their own without sacrificing usability for Apple users.

As the WebKit contributors quickly adopted AVIF, one may wonder why it would take Apple so long to implement it. **The reason is that Apple implements a new format in its operating system, not in its browsers. ** While AVIF support is available in the WebKitGTK and WPE ports, it is unavailable in the Apple Safari ports. Apple allows Safari to interface with the operating system to determine which file formats it will support. **The browser does not decode images. The operating system does it.**

Sam Sneddon, a software engineer at Apple, currently working for WebKit, confirmed this with his statement in the WebKit bug tracker: "The Apple ports use the system-provided image decoding capabilities; we're unlikely to deviate from that here, so any support for AVIF depends on underlying OS support. I can't comment as to whether any future OS releases will support AVIF."

Jon Henshaw writes in his blog post on coywolf.news that Apple releases OS and Safari updates only twice a year. All of the current beta operating systems do not support AVIF. Whether it is macOS Monterey (12) iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, watchOS 8 or iOS 15. **We will most likely have to wait at least six months before Safari supports AVIF, if not much longer than that.**
