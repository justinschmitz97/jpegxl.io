## What is QuickLook?

Apple Inc. has developed a Quick Look feature that was first introduced in its operating system, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. On June 11, 2007, the feature was announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Finder users have always been able to view the contents of a file at a smaller size in getting Info windows or column views. Still, Quick Look permits users to view the contents of a file at full or near-full size regardless of the document size relative to the screen resolution. Document formats supported include PDFs, HTML, QuickTime readable media, plain text and RTF, iWork documents (Keynote, Pages, and Numbers), Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) (including OOXML), and RAW camera images. Alternatively, Quick Look can be launched from the command line and opened in full screen. In addition, the slide previews at the side of the preview window can be used to navigate multi-page documents such as PowerPoint slide shows. With Mac OS X 10.5, Quick Look technology is implemented across the entire Apple software suite, including iChat Theater, Time Machine, and the Finder's Cover Flow.
