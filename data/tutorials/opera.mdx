## What is Opera?

Opera is a free web browser that is available for both computers and smartphones. Mobile apps are available for iOS and Android and the Opera browser on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Both Opera Touch, which is designed for smartphones, and Opera Mini, which is faster and more data-efficient, are available for both Android and iOS. A Norwegian telecommunications company developed the Opera web browser in 1995 as part of a research project. Since then, the browser has undergone numerous updates to keep up with technological advancements and respond to new developments. Every two weeks, Opera introduces new features and updates. One of the best features of Opera is its battery-saving capabilities. Opera reports that its battery saver can increase battery life by as much as 35% compared to other browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. According to the type and specifications of your laptop, this may result in an additional hour of battery life.

To conclude, Opera is a highly modern web browser featuring numerous features such as built-in messenger, crypto wallet support, battery saving features, enhanced privacy and security, and an ad blocker.
