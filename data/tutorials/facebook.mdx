## What is JPEG XL?

## What is Facebook?

Users who register for a free account on Facebook can connect with friends, work colleagues, or people they do not know online. Users have the option of sharing pictures, music, videos, articles, and their thoughts and opinions with as many people as they choose. The two profiles are connected once they are accepted, and both users can view everything that the other person posts. Users of Facebook may upload anything to their "timeline", a snapshot of what is happening at any given moment. They may also enter a private chat with other Facebook friends. On their profiles, people provide information about themselves. Users post various information about themselves, whether their employment status, where they study, their ages, or other personal details. All of this information is easily accessible to their friends and the public. Additionally, users can "like" other pages that interest them.
