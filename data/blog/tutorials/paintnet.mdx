## What is AVIF

The Alliance for Open Media developed the AVIF file format to make our images smaller while maintaining the same image quality. According to experts, it represents a significant step forward in the compression of media. The goal of AOMedia is to develop open, royalty-free technology for multimedia distribution, which means that no one will have to pay anyone to use the new AVIF format. Behind AOMedia, we find big companies such as Netflix, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Currently, JPG and PNG are the most popular image formats for use on the web. Several years ago, Google developed WebP, which delivers images 30% smaller than JPG while maintaining the same image quality. With AVIF, photos will be 50% smaller, and the image quality will remain the same.

## What is Paint.NET

As its name implies, Paint.NET was created to replace Microsoft Paint. Paint is a simple tool that can be used to perform simple tasks, but most users won't use it beyond simple doodles. That is where Paint.NET can help. Paint.NET, which was originally created with Microsoft's support as a potential replacement, has become an independent project, maintained by a single developer, and offers tools and capabilities more closely related to Adobe Photoshop and GIMP than its namesake. The strength of Paint.NET lies in its simplicity. Instead of emphasizing an endless number of extra features, Paint.NET has a simple and easy-to-understand user interface, making it easy for users to pick up, create, and edit digital images.

## Paint.NET supports AVIF

A new Paint.NET update includes full support for AV1 (_.avif) images, courtesy of @null54's AvifFileType plugin, which has been bundled. In addition to opening AV1 (_.avif) images, @null54's AvifFileType plugin (v1.1.4.0) can now also be saved (and not just opened). There is no need to install Microsoft's codec from the Microsoft Store, which works on both Windows 7 and 8.1.

## How to open AVIF files

In order to view AVIF files, you simply import them into the image viewer. In order to export an artboard as an AVIF, simply go Files -> Save As and choose AVIF as the image format. A prompt will appear with several settings you can choose in order to change the quality, speed of the compression, Chrome subsampling and some more. Press OK to save the file.
