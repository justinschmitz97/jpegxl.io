## What is Pinterest

Pinterest allows users to find inspiration for everything from recipes to home decor to style.

Pinterest is a visual approach to social bookmarking. In contrast to other social bookmarking sites, such as Digg and StumbleUpon, Pinterest's content is entirely visual. An image is required to share something on Pinterest. It is possible to share photos you find online or to upload images directly to Pinterest. Using the Pin It button, you can share directly from any web page in your browser. Your pins can also be shared on Twitter and Facebook.

## AVIF support

To this date, Pinterest does not allow uploading AVIF images. Pinterest will throw an error that the file type is not supported. There are no public plans for when Pinterest will allow AVIF.
