## What is AVIF

Digitalization depends on file compression because it can relieve the network infrastructure of its resources sustainably. Long-term, AVIF aims to make data traffic more efficient and replace the widely used JPEG format. AVIF provides more excellent image quality and compression as compared to JPEG. Corporations in the digital industry are interested in implementing the new image format. An image format combining the best compression with a broad range of available options is AVIF. It is possible to compress data losslessly as well as lossily. The alpha channel, like other image and graphic formats, stores additional information about transparent image areas. In interfaces such as user interfaces and collages, and company logos, transparency data are released as objects. AVIF also supports extended color spaces (Wide Color Gamut, WCG) and functions such as graininess, color undersampling, and HDR (High Dynamic Range).

## What is Thunderbird

Thunderbird is a free, open-source application that is cross-platform and can manage email, news feeds, chats, and newsgroups. It is an email application that is extremely powerful (rather than browser-based or web-based) yet very easy to use. Thunderbird is developed, tested, translated, and supported mainly by volunteers and by paid staff. Developed by the Thunderbird community, Thunderbird is an independent project. Due to this, the Thunderbird Council, which is elected by the Thunderbird community, manages and oversees the paid staff, the budget, and fundraising. Contributions from the Thunderbird community enable Thunderbird development. Thunderbird is no longer developed by Mozilla Corporation, the makers of Firefox and Mozilla Messaging. Mozilla does, however, continue to provide support for Thunderbird by hosting many of its resources. Thunderbird is available for free. Thunderbird has several exciting features. Thunderbird gives you complete control and ownership over your email. Thunderbird offers a large number of add-ons for extending and customizing your email experience. Thunderbird's roots lie in Mozilla, so it adheres to the Mozilla Manifesto, which describes a commitment to an open, accessible, and egalitarian internet.

## AVIF support

Thunderbird has supported AVIF behind a developer flag since 15.09.2020. Ensure that you are using the latest version of Thunderbird. Select Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> General and click on the Config Editor button. Make sure that image.avif.enabled is set to true manually for AVIF.
