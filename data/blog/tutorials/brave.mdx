## What is AVIF

AVIF files are images that adhere to the AV1 Image file format. As with JPEG, it uses compression to reduce the size of the file while maintaining quality. Because AVIF files have more excellent quality to compression ratio than JPEG, they can be compressed much smaller without degrading in quality. The format was created by the Alliance for Open Media, an association whose members include Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Mozilla. Files are compressed using the AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) algorithm and are stored in HEIF containers. As this image format utilizes the AV1 compression technology, it is a royalty-free format. Therefore, there is no licensing fee, which means that compression and decoding of files can be done without paying any royalties. AVIF has the apparent advantage of having a smaller file size than other formats such as JPEG. Smaller file sizes will require less bandwidth, resulting in reduced data usage and storage. If all of the images on a web page have been replaced with AVIFs, the amount of data consumed by images would be half as much. AVIF also offers greater color depth than JPEG. AVIF supports HDR, whereas the latter is limited to 8-bit color depth. This translates to richer colors and more detail.

## What is Brave

Based on the Chromium web browser, Brave is a free and open-source web browser that blocks online advertisements and website trackers by default, which allows it to distinguish itself from other browsers. The application also enables users to turn on optional advertisements that reward them for their attention with Basic Attention Tokens. In return for these tips, users are provided with the option to retain the cryptocurrency they earned and the ability to contribute to websites and content creators.

## AVIF support

Brave is based on Chromium, a free and open-source codebase for a web browser. Several browsers rely on the engine, such as Microsoft Edge and Opera. Due to Chromium fully supporting AVIF, viewing AVIF images with Brave is possible as well. If you visit a website that uses AVIF, you will be able to see it like any other image.
