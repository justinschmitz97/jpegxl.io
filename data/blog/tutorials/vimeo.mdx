## What is AVIF

AVIF files are images stored in the AV1 Image file format developed by the Alliance for Open Media. In addition to JPEG, PNG, and WEBP, the AV1 Image format was designed to replace them. The Alliance for Open Media was founded in 2015 by several high-profile technology companies, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Netflix. The workgroup developed several open-source media technologies and standards, including the AV1 video codec. After some investigation, the workgroup concluded that the AV1 codec could be applied to images saved in the HEIF format. As a result of this effort, the workgroup was able to develop the AV1 Image format, which can save high-quality, compressed images within files the same size as JPEG images of lower quality. AVIF supports HDR and monochrome images and color depths of 8, 10, and 12 bits. Additionally, it can support both lossless and lossy compressions.

## What is Vimeo

Vimeo is an online video-sharing platform that contains features such as live streaming and customization. As an ad-free platform, it generates revenues through subscriptions for businesses and content creators and software as a service (SaaS). Video creation, editing, broadcast tools, and connection with clients are included in these services. Vimeo is an excellent tool for creating high-quality, professional videos and reaching audiences across the globe.

## AVIF support

In June 2021, Vimeo has released AVIF support for their video thumbnails. According to their statement, this allows them to load thumbnails faster, improving SEO and web page performance.

Due to its membership in the Alliance for Open Media (the organization which developed the AVIF specifications), Vimeo can participate in the development of these new technologies and other leading tech companies, and therefore, be among the first to adopt them. The next-generation technologies, such as AV1 and Opus, and now AVIF, are being used by leading technology companies such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, and many others.
