## What is AVIF

The AVIF format refers to the AV1 format of images. By using the AVIF format, you can reduce the size of your images without sacrificing quality (lossless compression). AVIF files have the extension .avif. To improve compression efficiency and add more features than existing formats, AOM developed the AVIF format. As with its predecessors (WebP, JPEG-XR, JPEG2000, PNG, and GIF), AVIF is compatible with images that exhibit a high dynamic range. Furthermore, it can capture full-color images at 10- and 12-bit resolution and produce images ten times smaller than other formats. AVIF is revolutionizing the industry. As a result of its potential features, it is likely to be supported on all platforms within a short time.

## What is ProtonMail

In 2013 scientists who worked at the CERN research facility founded ProtonMail, an end-to-end encrypted email service. Unlike other typical email providers such as Gmail and Outlook.com, ProtonMail uses client-side encryption to protect the content of emails and user data before they are sent to ProtonMail servers. The service can be obtained through a webmail client, the Tor network, or dedicated iOS and Android apps. The parent company of ProtonMail, Proton Technologies AG, is located in the Canton of Geneva. ProtonVPN is another service offered by the company. A crowdfunding campaign provided initial funding to ProtonMail. Although the account setup is unrestricted by default, the service is supported by optional fees. ProtonMail was initially accessible only by invitation, but it became public in March 2016. As of 2017, ProtonMail had over 2 million users, which increased to over 5 million by September 2018, 20 million by the end of 2019, and over 50 million by 2020.

## AVIF support

ProtonMail supports AVIF in its latest version for Android (11+). Additionally, the web-based version provides inline viewing of AVIF files.
