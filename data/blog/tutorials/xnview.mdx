## What is AVIF

AV1 Codec is a format for encoding videos that is royalty-free and open-source. The AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) format is intended to be a video format designed for the web. The AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) was developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) and is designed specifically for image files. This specification describes how to store images or image sequences compressed with AV1 in HEIF format. AVIF is a newly developed image format that makes images smaller while preserving their quality without degradation. The use of this format is also royalty-free, it offers better compression than existing image formats, and it supports a broader range of features than existing formats. HDR support is another critical advantage over other formats. The new format is supported by several well-known companies, including Apple, Google, VideoLAN, Facebook, and Netflix. The AVIF format is compatible with high dynamic range images as opposed to image formats including WebP, JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, and GIF. Supporting up to 12 bits of color at full resolution, it provides images up to ten times smaller than other formats. The AVIF format provides animated, transparent, and lossless images.
