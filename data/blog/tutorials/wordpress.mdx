## No official support

There is no official AVIF support. **WordPress recently started to support WebP files with the 5.8 update called Tatum**, released to the public on July 20, 2021. This update is a good indication that WordPress maybe keeps other file formats in mind. However, since it took more than a decade to support WebP, we don't expect support for AVIF to be implemented soon.

**WordPress needs AVIF support for two reasons:**

1. Technicians and end-users often have to deal with page load speed problems with this CMS. Thus, AVIF can contribute to faster loading without causing any quality loss due to its minimal file size.

2. WordPress is the world's most dominant CMS, with over 455 million websites in 2020. This means that WordPress powers about 35% of the web. Further statistics of WordPress show that in November 2020, over 409 million people view more than 20 billion pages every month.

## Security check

"Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons."

Since version 4.7, the WordPress core has implemented a security check for uploading files. WordPress checks the file extension of your uploaded files and rejects files that do not match their pattern. You experience the same behavior when trying to upload SVGs.

The same applies to modern image formats. **To date, WordPress does not support viewing or uploading AVIF images or other modern formats natively.**

We could argue that AVIF is a new extension. Considering that WebP is more than ten years old and was just recently adopted, the question arises whether WordPress will ever add support for modern image formats. Fortunately, there are several ways around this security check.

Nowadays, many plugin solutions exist from **image CDN providers to automatically convert your uploaded images to modern formats** on the fly.
We can also disable the security check for uploading AVIF files if you want to do the manual work.

## Using an image CDN Plugin

Several plugin solutions exist that originate in image CDN providers. Most of them offer a simple setup routine with automatic conversion. You don't have to deal with code or complex settings. Most plugins change the HTML content of your post to replace the base URL with their endpoint so that images are loaded via the CDN.

## Manually uploading

WordPress restricts files that do not match its list of Internet media types, also known as content types or mime-types. The MIME type is a two-part identifier for file formats and format content transferred on the Internet. It is pretty simple to explain: A media file consists of a type and a subtype that defines content and file extension. An HTML file has the mime-type text/html, and a jpg has the mime-type image/jpeg.

<Image url="mimetype" alt="example showing mime types" />
WordPress uses these mime types. They have a list of files they allow and a list
of files they disallow. There are several methods to change this behavior and add
mime types.

### Solution 1: Funtions.php

Functions.php is a file that appears on every theme in WordPress and contains basic functionalities. You can open it by going to Appearance and choosing the Theme Editor. If a warning appears, confirm you know what you are doing. Select your active theme in the right sidebar, and below you will find all theme files listed, including functions.php.

<Image url="functionsphp" alt="place where the functions.php is located" />
Click to open the file and scroll down to the bottom. Create a new line after the
end of the file, and add the following. This code will allow you to upload AVIF files
just like you upload any other image. If you wish to add more support for all the
new image formats, copy the code below.
<Syntax language="php">
  {`function allow_modern_images( $mime_types ) {
  $mime_types['webp'] = 'image/webp';
  $mime_types['heic'] = 'image/heic';
  $mime_types['heif'] = 'image/heif';
  $mime_types['heics'] = 'image/heic-sequence';
  $mime_types['heifs'] = 'image/heif-sequence';
  $mime_types['avif'] = 'image/avif';
  $mime_types['avis'] = 'image/avif-sequence';
  return $mime_types
}
add_filter( 'upload_mimes', 'allow_modern_images', 1, 1 );`}
</Syntax>

### Solution 2: FTP Upload

Another way to bypass the restriction is to upload your files via FTP. Connect to your server and drop your images in the upload folder, where most of your current photos should be saved. If you don't know how to access your files directly, please ask your web host. Most providers offer great tutorials.

### Solution 3: Mime-Type Plugins

There's a considerable disadvantage when modifying the functions.php. It's theme-related. Whenever you switch a theme or update your current one, the shortcode snippet will be gone. Multiple plugin solutions exist for this issue:

<Checklist items={["WP Add Mime Types", "Lord of the Files"]} checked={true} />

To quote: WordPress relies primarily on name-based validation when deciding whether or not to allow a particular file, leaving the door open for various kinds of attacks. Lord of the Files (previously known as "blob mimes") adds to this content-based validation and sanitizing, ensuring that files are what they say they are and safe for inclusion on your site.

<Image url="mimetype-plugin" alt="screenshot of the mime type plugin website" />

### No automatic conversion

Uploading images is an excellent thing, but a colossal problem remains. For every image you want to serve to your users, you need to convert it manually. Bulk converters like avif.io offer a solution to convert multiple files. However, using the HTML picture tag remains. A more straightforward idea would be an image plugin that automatically converts images to modern formats and offers the best solution based on your user's browser.

## Summary

WordPress does not support AVIF and most likely won't support it shortly. Use a CDN plugin to enable support today.
