## What is Photopea

Ivan Kutskir has developed the free online photo editing tool Photopea. Photopea is a powerful image editor that supports both raster and vector graphics. It is primarily used to edit raster and vector graphics, supporting PSD, AI, XD, Illustrator, Figma, and Sketch files. The program can be used for simple tasks, such as resizing images, and more complex tasks, such as designing websites, creating illustrations, and processing photographs.
Web browsers are used to access the Photopea editor. Photopea can be run on various devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, and any other computer).

The Photopea application runs entirely within your device, just as Sketch or Photoshop do. Your files are not uploaded to the internet. With Photopea.com, you can disconnect from the internet and use it entirely offline. Your files will never leave your computer.

## AVIF support

There have been two issues on Github regarding support for the AVIF format. Support for the AVIF format still lacked at the time of the first issue in June 2020. As of March 2021, the developer has added support for AVIF by decoding them using the browser. As a result, Photopea will be able to display AVIF on every browser that can display AVIF.
