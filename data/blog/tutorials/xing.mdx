## What is Xing

Xing is the German equivalent of Linkedin. It is an online business networking platform that enables you to connect with like-minded professionals, find new employment opportunities, and share knowledge and insights within your feed and interest groups. In the same sense that Linkedin is the global globetrotter who builds connections around the globe, Xing is the local professional focused on building a network in German-speaking countries.

XING is a professional social network. Currently, 15 million people are registered with XING. Professionals from various industries can meet, find jobs, colleagues, new assignments, cooperation partners, experts, and generate new business ideas on this platform. Members can participate in specialist groups and exchange views, as well as participate in networking activities.

## AVIF support

Xing does not accept AVIF files and throws an error during upload.
