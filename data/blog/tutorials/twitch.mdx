## What is Twitch

Twitch is a live streaming service for gamers that was launched in 2011. Since then, it has attracted millions of users. Twitch provides gamers and anyone interested in lifestyle casting about other subjects such as food or music the opportunity to live stream their activities and have others watch them in real-time. Streams can last anywhere from a few seconds to several hours. A stream can be found by browsing various categories, including specific games. If you find a streamer you enjoy, you can follow their channel to receive activity updates and notifications. Since its launch, Twitch has partnered with gaming companies such as Blizzard Entertainment and the Overwatch League to offer worldwide gaming and esports events.

Streamers can sell products associated with their streams through Twitch affiliate links and receive commissions for sales made via streaming links. On Twitch, viewers can comment alongside each other and depending on the channel, you may be able to ask questions or make suggestions and receive answers in real-time. You will also be able to watch previously streamed shows and gameplay on Twitch.

## AVIF support

Twitch allows you to create a profile picture and a banner. For whatever reason the profile image editor fully supports AVIF, even with editing and cropping mechanisms, even though the below message says it only supports JPEG, PNG and GIF. This may be due to the Image API converting the image in realtime.

However, if you are trying to use an AVIF for your banner, Twitch refuses to accept it. There are no public plans for adopting AVIF.
