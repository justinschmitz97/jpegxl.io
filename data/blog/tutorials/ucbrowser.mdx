## What is UC Browser?

UC Browser is a mobile web browser developed by Chinese tech company UCWeb - Jack Ma's Alibaba Group subsidiary. The UC Browser is the second most popular web browser in China. The app was the most popular browser in India before being banned by the Indian government in 2020. Therefore, usage of the world's most popular web browser, Google Chrome, is limited in China. In China, Google Search and other services are not accessible without the use of a VPN. That's where UC Browser steps in to provide mobile users a smooth experience browsing the web and downloading files.
UC Browser is available on iOS and Android - although the app is only available through Apple's App Store in China. The app is available globally on the Google Play Store. The app's main features include a feature-rich downloads manager, a data saver, and 50GB of free cloud storage. Users also enjoy the ability to download videos to watch offline and also the ability to play music and videos in the background.

## AVIF Support

Through our testing, UC Browser does not currently support viewing AVIF images on Android or iOS. While UC Browser is loosely based on the Chromium framework, it doesn't inherit the latest features released by Google. There are currently no public plans to support AVIF images in the future.
