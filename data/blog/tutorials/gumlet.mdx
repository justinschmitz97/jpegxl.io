## What is AVIF

The AV1 Image Format (AVIF) is a new image format that supports multiple image codecs. It significantly reduces the file size and supports Android, Chrome, and Firefox. AVIF is an alternative format to JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF, which has a higher compression ratio and broader feature support than these other formats. AVIF is intended to replace JPEG and other established formats. AVIF results from more than three decades of research and development in image and video compression technology. An open-source video compression standard called AV1 has been developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM). The same compression can also be used to compress images, called the AV1 Image File Format (AVIF). Due to this format's superior quality and better compression, the end-user can obtain much better-looking images for a smaller file size than when using JPEG.

## What is Gumlet

Gumlet provides image optimization and delivery services via the cloud. The company optimizes images for thousands of websites and mobile applications. They aim to empower every developer to provide the best-looking images to their end-users while reducing page weight. Gumlet is easy to use and will reduce the weight of your web page by more than 40%. Gumlet automatically resizes and compresses images. Multiple plans are available, including unlimited master images and image optimizations, no limitations on cache storage, and detailed usage analytics. Their free plan provides usage of one website, 1 GB of bandwidth per month, and $1 for each additional GB. Advanced plans offer unlimited websites, priority support, custom domains, comprehensive reports, and fallback mechanisms.

## Gumlet supports AVIF

Using format=auto, Gumlet automatically determines the best format for the user's browser. Users of Google Chrome, for example, will be able to view web content in AVIF format.
