## AVIF

Based on the AV1 standard, the AVIF format is an image format. Your images can be compressed without losing quality by using the AVIF format. Alliance for Open Media developed the AVIF format to provide more features than other formats and improve compression efficiency. AVIF is compatible with high dynamic range images, and it is capable of capturing full-color images with 10- and 12-bit resolutions. In addition, the compressed images produced by AVIF are ten times smaller than those produced by other formats. AVIF is reshaping the industry. Due to its potential features, it is likely to be supported across all platforms soon.

## ChromeOS

The Chrome OS operating system was designed for Chromebooks and is developed and owned by Google. The operating system is based on the open-source Chromium OS. Chromium OS is a modified version of Linux and, like Android, is open-source. Despite this, Chrome OS is a proprietary operating system available only through Google-endorsed devices. Chrome OS's main advantage is its ease of use, making it popular with children, students, and those less accustomed to desktop computers. Chrome OS, while offering a similar desktop environment to Windows, is primarily a web browser. As its main interface, the OS uses the Google Chrome web browser. In 2011, Chrome OS was released as an alternative to Windows and macOS. Google's Chrome OS is among the most accessible and consumer-oriented Linux operating systems.

## ChromeOS AVIF support

At this time, Chrome OS doesn’t support the read/write of AVIF images and sequences. This is despite Google Chrome’s enthusiastic support of the fledgling image standard. Users can view and decode AVIF images on the web through the Google Chrome browser. However, locally Chrome OS users can’t view or create AVIF on their Chromebooks. There are no plans currently for Google to include AVIF in future updates as of September 2021.
