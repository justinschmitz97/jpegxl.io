## What is LibrePhotos

LibrePhotos is a fork of Ownphotos. It describes itself as a self-hosted version of Google Photos. It's a photo management service, but with some neat graphs thrown in for fun. LibrePhotos provides support for photos and videos, including generating event-based albums and timeline views. It is capable of scanning images on your file system and facilitating semantic image searching. It is also capable of recognizing and classifying faces and objects.

## AVIF support

At the end of 2020, a Github issue was created. The creator of this issue asks for the possibility to read or use AVIF images as the default image format. A developer responded on the 26th of July 2021 that since AVIF is not supported by all browsers yet, they will focus on WebP support instead. It is uncertain whether they will use AVIF once support has grown.
