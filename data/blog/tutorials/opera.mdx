## What is JPEG XL?

## What is XYZ?

Opera is a free internet browser that is available for both computers and mobile devices. There are mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as the Opera browser for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Opera Touch, which is designed for smartphones, is also available on both Android and iOS, along with Opera Mini, which is more data-efficient and faster. A Norwegian telecommunications company developed the original Opera web browser as part of a research project in 1995. Since that time, the browser has received numerous updates to keep up with technological advances and to respond to new innovations. Opera has a rapid development cycle and introduces new features and updates every two weeks. There are many outstanding features of Opera, but one of the best is Opera's battery-saving feature. Opera reports that its battery saver can increase battery life by up to 35% compared to other browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This could provide an additional hour of battery life, depending on the type and specifications of your laptop.

In conclusion, Opera is a highly modern web browser that includes special features such as built-in messenger, crypto wallet support, battery saving features, enhanced privacy and security, and an ad blocker.
