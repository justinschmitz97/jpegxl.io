## What is AVIF

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) describes the specifications for storing images compressed with AV1 within the HEIF file format. [164] It competes with HEIC, which uses the same container format as AVIF, but uses HEVC for compression. The AVIF specification version 1.0.0 was finalized in February 2019. AVIF supports features like High-dynamic-range, Color spaces or ICC profiles, lossless compression and lossy compression, 8-10-12 bit color depth, Monochrome (alpha/depth), or multi-components, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4 chroma subsampling, and film grain.

## What is Opera?

Opera is a free internet browser that is available for both computers and mobile devices. There are mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as the Opera browser for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Opera Touch, which is designed for smartphones, is also available on both Android and iOS, along with Opera Mini, which is more data-efficient and faster. A Norwegian telecommunications company developed the original Opera web browser as part of a research project in 1995. Since that time, the browser has received numerous updates to keep up with technological advances and to respond to new innovations. Opera has a rapid development cycle and introduces new features and updates every two weeks. There are many outstanding features of Opera, but one of the best is Opera's battery-saving feature. Opera reports that its battery saver can increase battery life by up to 35% compared to other browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This could provide an additional hour of battery life, depending on the type and specifications of your laptop.

In conclusion, Opera is a highly modern web browser that includes special features such as built-in messenger, crypto wallet support, battery saving features, enhanced privacy and security, and an ad blocker.

## View AVIF in Opera

Opera fully supports AVIF as of September 2020. By dragging AVIF images into Opera, you can open them. If you browse a website that uses an AVIF image, you will also be able to view that image.

## Opera Mini

Unfortunately, Opera Mini does not support AVIF images yet. Implementation will likely take a little longer since the app is not written on the Chromium codebase like the desktop alternative. Chromium offers native AVIF support since Google has added it to the core.
