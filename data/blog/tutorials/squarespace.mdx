## What is SquareSpace?

A website builder such as Squarespace is designed to assist individuals and organizations in creating great websites. Squarespace does not require any coding skills on your part. We can build a stunning website for you, complete with features such as built-in eCommerce checkout tools, a custom domain name, and SSL certificate protection.

Squarespace was founded in 2003 in Maryland within the United States. In the beginning, it was nothing more than a blog hosting service, but it evolved into something far more substantial. Revenues reached $1 million by the end of 2006. Squarespace is a website-building solution that almost anyone can use. Still, its primary focus is on designers, artists, photographers, and other creative professionals.

Create an account with us, select a template for your website, and you can begin editing it according to your needs. The beautiful design options available through Squarespace have made it one of the most popular options in the eCommerce and online selling market.

## SquareSpace AVIF support

To this date, SquareSpace does not support AVIF or WebP. Despite a public discussion, there are no official plans to adding support.
