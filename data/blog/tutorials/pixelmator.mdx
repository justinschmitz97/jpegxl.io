## What is AVIF

AVIF is an image file format created by Alliance for Open Media that reduces the size of images while preserving quality. This represents a significant improvement in the compression of media, according to experts. It is an essential objective of AOMedia to develop open and royalty-free multimedia delivery technologies, which means that no one will be charged for using the new AVIF format. Netflix, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are some of the large companies behind AOMedia. Currently, JPG and PNG are the most widely used image formats for the web. With the WebP format, developed by Google several years ago, images can be 30% smaller while maintaining the same level of quality as JPGs. With AVIF, photos will be 50% smaller than JPGs while retaining the same quality.

## What is Pixelmator

Pixelmator is a graphic editor developed for Mac and iOS platforms. In addition to selection, painting, retouching, navigation, and color correction tools, Pixelmator includes layers-based image editing, GPU-based image processing, color management, automation, and a transparent head-up display user interface to enable working with images. Pixelmator utilizes Core Image and OpenGL technologies to process images. Pixelmator Pro is an image editing program that provides access to the most powerful professional tools. Numerous tools are available for editing and retouching photographs, creating graphic designs, painting, and drawing vector graphics.

## Pixelmator supports AVIF

Currently, Pixelmator is not able to view AVIF images. Pixelmator, however, was the first commercial image editor to support the WebP image format for Mac fully. There is a thread in their community forum asking for AVIF support. It has been confirmed that this is on their roadmap.
