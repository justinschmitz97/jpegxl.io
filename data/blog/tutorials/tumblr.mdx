## What is Tumblr

You can easily share anything on Tumblr. Post text, photos, quotes, links, music, and videos from your browser, phone, desktop, or email, whichever is convenient for you. It is a combination of a social networking website and a blog. It is often called a microblog since users usually post short text snippets and quick snapshots in place of longer, diary-like entries typically found on traditional blogs.

There is a significant difference between Tumblr and other social networks due to the site's free-form nature and the ability of users to customize their pages. This is an exception to the rule since most other social networks have standardized profiles with limited design flexibility. As a result of Tumblr's lack of limitations or restrictions on the types of content that can be created and the design of the pages where this content is displayed, it is impossible to narrow its definition. The company itself claims Tumblr is both easy to use and difficult to understand due to its wide range of content, ranging from text and images to music and videos addressing specific fan groups, subcultures, businesses, social issues, and other concerns.

## AVIF support

For some reason, Tumblr shows the AVIF image in the modal that lets you create a new post.

<Image url="tumblr" alt="tumblr shows avif with error message" />

Still, Quora refuses to load AVIF and throws a 404 error trying to publish an AVIF image.

<Image url="tumblr-404" alt="tumblr 404 message" />
<Image
  url="tumblr-fileformats"
  alt="tumblr error displaying supported formats"
/>
