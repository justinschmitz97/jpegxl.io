## What is AVIF

AVIF, or the AV1 Image format, is the most recent image compression format. The AVIF format is a way to reduce the size of images while maintaining the same quality (lossless compression). Their .avif extension identifies AVIF files. AVIF is a royalty-free image format developed by AOM to provide better compression efficiency and more features than any existing format. Like its predecessors (WebP, JPEG-XR, JPEG2000, PNG, and GIF), AVIF is compatible with images exhibiting a high dynamic range. In addition, the format can capture images in full color at 10- and 12-bit resolution, producing images that are up to ten times smaller than those in other formats. AVIF is a game-changing format that will soon become the industry standard. As a result of its potential features, it will likely be supported on all platforms shortly.

## What is Outlook

Microsoft provides a free web-based email service known as Outlook.com. There is some similarity to Google's Gmail service, but with the addition of a link to your desktop Outlook data. In addition to combining Hotmail and Windows Live into a single email service, Microsoft has added support for contacts (including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) and your calendar. Sign up for an Outlook.com account by visiting the website and clicking the "Sign up now" link located at the bottom of the page. Once you have entered the appropriate personal information, created an email address, and created a password, complete the process. Logging in directly is possible if you have a Hotmail or Windows Live account or a Messenger, SkyDrive, Windows Phone, or Xbox LIVE account. By the way, all existing Hotmail and Windows Live accounts will be converted to Outlook.com, but your email address will not be changed. It offers the best of both worlds - the latest technology combined with the same email address.

## AVIF support

Both the new Android (11+) and Web-based versions of Outlook support viewing AVIF images inline. As you would with any other file format, just attach the image inline.
