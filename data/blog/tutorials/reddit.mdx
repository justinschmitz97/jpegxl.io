## What is Reddit

Reddit is one of many specialized discussion forums available on the internet. Still, if you seek news, debate, answers, or just some fun about practically anything you can imagine, this is the place to go. Reddit refers to itself as "the front page of the Internet". There are several forums on Reddit in which registered users can discuss nearly anything imaginable, from news, pop culture, technology, comics, films, literature, and the weirdest things in life, including Not Safe For Work content.

As a social platform, Reddit combines web content, social news, a forum, and a social network. You can contribute content to the site by submitting images, texts, videos, and links. The members of the site can vote up or down any content that appears on the site. By implementing this meritocratic system, exciting content rises to the top while uninteresting content falls to the bottom. Due to this, Reddit is the birthplace of the majority of internet memes and viral videos.

## AVIF support

Reddit does not support modern image formats and kindly displays an error message.
