## What is AVIF

When building a website, there are many image formats to choose from such as GIF, BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, SVG, WebP, AVIF. When it comes to choosing image formats for a website, how should a developer select ones that offer the best performance and quality? There are so many formats available that it can be difficult to choose the best one.

Having multiple options for next-generation image formats is beneficial, however it complicates planning and coding. It has become increasingly challenging to determine when, which format, and how to select a format for an image. It is important that developers consider the tradeoff between optimizing for quality, image payload size (and speed of page loading), and code complexity. In addition, each new format makes the process of analyzing tradeoffs more challenging.

It is an image format that offers better compression, better image quality, and more features than traditional formats such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF, and even the relatively new WebP.

## What is ImageEngine

Using an image CDN is the easiest and most convenient solution. CDNs are designed specifically to deliver high-quality, high-performance images while traversing the jungle of image formats. If you are looking to relieve yourself of the burden of managing multiple image formats while at the same time making sure that your users receive the best visual quality at the least file size, an image CDN such as ImageEngine with AVIF support would be a wise choice. Faster page loading is achieved with ImageEngine's AVIF conversion. ImageEngine achieves this through: Automatic device-aware image optimization, Smart compression and quality thresholds, and a built-in global CDN.

## ImageEngine supports AVIF

Since the end of 2020, ImageEngine supports AVIF. ImageEngine offers a free 30-day trial without requiring a credit card. Through their global CDN, you can deliver up to 100GB of data. According to them, their mobile optimization is more effective. It is referred to as 'device-aware optimization'. Additional conversions, in-app optimization, and dedicated edge servers are included in more advanced plans.
