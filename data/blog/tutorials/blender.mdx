## What is AVIF

JPEG must be replaced by a standard that a) is broadly supported, b) has better compression efficiency, and c) has greater functionality. AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) has excellent potential. There is a new image format derived from the AV1 video keyframes called AVIF. The format is royalty-free and is already available in Chrome 85 on desktop. It is expected that Android support will be added shortly, Firefox is currently working on implementation, and although it took Safari 10 years to add WebP support, we do not believe we will see the same delay here since Apple created AV1 as well.

## What is Blender

Blender is an open-source software program for creating 3D models. It supports the entire 3D pipeline - modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking, video editing, and game development. Advanced users utilize Blender's Python API to customize the application and develop specialized tools frequently incorporated into future versions. With its unified pipeline and responsive development process, Blender is well suited for individuals and small studios. Blender is cross-platform and can run on various platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Macintosh computers. A consistent user experience is provided by the application's interface, which utilizes OpenGL. According to the list of supported platforms, the development team regularly tests those platforms to confirm specific compatibility.

## Blender AVIF support

On the Devtalk forum of Blender, users have been asking for support of WebP, JpegXL, and AVIF since December 2020. As of this writing, AVIF is not supported by Blender. Blender may or may not add AVIF support in the future.
