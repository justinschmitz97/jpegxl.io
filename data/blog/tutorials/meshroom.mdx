## What is Meshroom

Based on the AliceVision framework, Meshroom is a free and open-source 3D reconstruction software. AliceVision is a photogrammetric computer vision framework that offers algorithms for 3D reconstruction as well as camera tracking. Using AliceVision, you can develop, test, analyze, and reuse sophisticated computer vision algorithms based on a strong software foundation. MIT and industry have collaborated on the project in order to provide robust and high-quality algorithms for production use that are cutting-edge and robust.

## AVIF support

AVIF support was requested on the 23rd of December 2020 via a Github issue. A developer responded that Meshroom should easily support AVIF images since OpenImageIO supports AVIF and HEIF. On the 25th of February, a PR was merged. Unfortunately, only the Windows version currently supports AVIF, while Linux support is still being developed.
