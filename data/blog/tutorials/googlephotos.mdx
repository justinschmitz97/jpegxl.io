## What is Google Photos

The Google Photos service allows users to share and store their photos. Using automatic analysis, the service identifies the visual characteristics of photos. In terms of searching pictures, users can select from three big categories: People, Places, and Things. Google Photos can recognize images, even those of pets, grouping similar ones together; mapping landmarks and subject matters, including birthdays, buildings, animals, food, and more. The Photos service uses various machine learning methods to recognize photo content, automatically create albums, animate similar photos into videos, surface memories at significant dates, and enhance the quality of pictures and videos.

## AVIF support

To this date, Google Photos does not process uploaded AVIF images. Google is part of the development team of AVIF, so we can hopefully expect support soon.
