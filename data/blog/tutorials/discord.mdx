## What is AVIF

AVIF is a file format developed by Alliance for Open Media that compresses images without sacrificing quality. Experts consider it to be a significant development in the area of media compression. AOMedia's mission is to develop open, royalty-free technologies for delivering multimedia content to ensure that no one will be charged a fee for using the new AVIF format. AOMedia is backed by some of the most essential companies globally, including Netflix, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Presently, the most popular image formats for use on the Internet are JPG and PNG. Google introduced WebP several years ago, 30% smaller than JPG while retaining comparable image quality. AVIF images can now be 50% smaller than JPG images while still maintaining the same degree of quality.

## What is Discord

People worldwide use Discord to communicate and socialize with their friends and families using voice, video, and text chat. The Discord service is used to discuss various topics every day, from art projects and family trips to homework and mental health support. You can create communities of any size, but it is most commonly utilized by small and active groups who regularly communicate.

A majority of servers are private, invite-only spaces where friends and communities can stay in touch and spend time together. There are also larger, more open communities around specific topics, such as popular games like Minecraft and Fortnite. Because all conversations are opt-in, users have complete control over who they interact with and their experience on Discord. People enjoy Discord because it provides a space for their communities and groups of friends. It is a place where they can be themselves and spend time with people who share their interests and hobbies. There is no algorithm determining what they should see; there is no endless scrolling; there is no news feed. Shared interests drive discord conversations.

## AVIF support

As of right now, Discord is only targeting encoders with first-class hardware encoder support (as well as webRTC support). AV1 is not currently one of those encoders.
