## What is AVIF

AVIF stands for AV1 Image format. Using the AVIF format can reduce images' size without losing quality (lossless compression). AVIF files have the .avif extension. AOM developed the AVIF format to provide better compression efficiency and more features than existing formats. AVIF is compatible with images exhibiting a high dynamic range like its predecessors (WebP, JPEG-XR, JPEG2000, PNG, and GIF). It can also capture full-color images at 10- and 12-bit resolution and produce images ten times smaller than other formats. AVIF is changing the industry. It will likely be supported on all platforms soon due to its potential features.

## What is Yahoo

In 1997, Yahoo! Mail was launched as an email service by Yahoo!, now owned by Verizon. This provider offers four different email plans: three for personal use (Basic, Plus, and Ad-Free) and another for business purposes. Yahoo! Mail has 225 million users as of January 2020. Webmail, accessible via a standard web browser, allows users to access and manage their mailboxes. Some accounts supported standard mail protocols (POP3 and SMTP). In 2015, users were able to connect non-Yahoo email accounts to the webmail client.

## AVIF support

Newer versions of Android (11+) support AVIF, as does the Yahoo App. Additionally, the web-based version provides inline viewing of AVIF files.
