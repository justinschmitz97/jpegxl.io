## What is Webflow?

Webflow is a web-based design tool that lets you design, build, and launch responsive websites without writing a line of code. We offer a platform that allows you to go from an idea to a product that is ready for use. The design of Webflow is exceptional. This software bridges the gap between Squarespace, Wix, and the world's most popular Content Management System, WordPress. I find Webflow referred to as the following generation tool for building and launching websites by both professionals and newcomers due to its design flexibility, lightning-speed performance, and ease of use.

Webflow lets designers create professional, custom websites on a visual canvas without writing a single line of code. Design professional websites without writing a single line of code. You can go live on a fast, reliable, and hassle-free hosting network that scales with your business - with a few clicks. Implement new marketing campaigns and iterate on them without distracting your product development team.

## Webflow AVIF support

Despite a public thread asking for AVIF support, Webflow currently does not process AVIF images. Since the public discussion in webflow's 'ideas' forum did not gain much traffic, it is uncertain whether they will add support in future.
