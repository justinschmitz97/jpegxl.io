## What is Joomla?

Joomla is a content management system (CMS) created by open-source software. This application allows you to build robust and dynamic websites. The software has a user-friendly interface that enables you to utilize all its features to the fullest extent. Joomla has gained considerable popularity in the past decade and has evolved into one of the world's most widely used content management systems. It has attracted a large following since its launch in 2005. It is estimated that it has over 99 million downloads to date.

Joomla utilizes an object-oriented programming approach and a PHP-based database called MySQL. You can install it with one click from the web hosting control panel. There are hundreds of articles available online to assist you in the installation of Joomla. Many Joomla hosting providers are available.

Joomla uses a design architecture based on Model-View-Controller (MVC). Joomla first evaluates the URL to determine the component that will process the request according to the MVC pattern. Each component is provided with a model that contains the data it uses. The ModelModel is also responsible for updating the database as required. Views are responsible for producing output. They interact with the ModelModel to obtain the necessary information. After the view has produced its output, the component gives back control to the Joomla framework, which then executes the template.

## Joomla AVIF support

Joomla is interested in adding AVIF support and is waiting for the release of PHP 8.1 which includes native support for the file format.
