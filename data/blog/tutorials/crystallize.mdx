## What is AVIF

An AVIF (AV1 image format) is an open-source, royalty-free format for multichannel images. AVIF images have significantly smaller file sizes compared to JPEG, PNG, and WebP images. At present, they are compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Android devices. As a keyframe-based video format, AV1 was developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) in collaboration with Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org. There has already been considerable interest in the AVIF format. Netflix claims better image quality and smaller file size than JPEG, PNG, and even WebP formats. AVIF is an exciting development that has the potential to be widely adopted. There is undoubtedly a need for new advanced alternatives to JPEG, which has been around for decades.

## What is Crystallize

Crystallize is a headless commerce service with a GraphQL based personal information manager, enabling you to deliver a customized eCommerce experience. This solution helps you organize and manage product information for headless eCommerce, as well as subscriptions. With power webhooks and fulfillment pipelines, you can automate orders. Crystallize is for digital merchants selling products as a one-time sale or as subscriptions and need tailored eCommerce experiences based on data.

## AVIF support

The Crystallize website saw a significant reduction in size after AVIF support was added in September 2020. As with the automatic conversion of images uploaded to Crystallize to WebP, Crystallize will now automate the conversion of AVIF images. To tell the browser that you have AVIF images, you can use the same technique when loading a WebP image. The browser will then select the best image type it supports, and you will have backward compatibility with older browsers.
