## AVIF

AVIF is based on the AV1 video codec and is standardized by the Alliance for Open Media. AVIF offers more compression gains than other image formats such as JPEG and WebP. Our and other studies have shown that, depending on the content, encoding settings, and quality target, you can save up to 50% versus JPEG. The advanced image encoding feature of AVIF brings codec and container support for HDR and wide color gamut images, film grain synthesis, and progressive decoding. AVIF support has improved significantly since Chrome M85 implemented AVIF support last summer.

## Android

The Android operating system is an open-source mobile platform for smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs. As of 2008, the operating system is maintained by the search engine maker Google. A modified version of the Linux kernel is used to develop Google's Android mobile operating system. It is explicitly designed for touchscreen mobile devices.

Google's OS is used in phones from Samsung, OnePlus, HTC, and its own devices. Over three billion people use Android every month, making it the world's most popular operating system.

As of September 2020, Android 11 is the latest version of the mobile operating system.

## Android 11 AVIF support

Android 11 currently does not support viewing or saving AVIF files locally. Although there are limitations to the format, both Chrome for Mobile and the Android Browser support it. AVIF images can therefore be viewed online, but not when downloaded to your mobile device.

## Android 12 AVIF support

With new features like media transcoding support and AVIF support, Android 12 gives smartphone cameras a boost. Android 12 provides platform support for AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) for better image quality and compression.

Later this year, Android 12 will release some exciting new features, including improvements to photos and videos. Developers can make videos compatible with older devices and players thanks to Google's latest mobile operating system. Most importantly to regular users, AVIF supports high-quality images while occupying less space on a hard drive.

As of now, Google does not plan to make AVIF the default format on the platform. Given AVIF's position as an excellent all-around format, some industry experts predict it will become Google's default format shortly.
