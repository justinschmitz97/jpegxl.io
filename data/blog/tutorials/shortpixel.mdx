## What is AVIF

The AVIF format is an image file format designed by the Alliance for Open Media in order to help reduce the size and quality of our images. According to experts, it represents a significant step forward in media compression. AOMedia is committed to developing open, royalty-free technologies for multimedia delivery, which means that no one will have to pay anyone to use the new AVIF format (instead of, for example, JPG). AOMedia is backed by large companies such as Netflix, Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft.

At present, the most popular image file formats for the web are JPG and PNG. The WebP format, developed by Google several years ago, delivered images 30% smaller than JPGs while maintaining the same image quality. Now, AVIF offers images 50% smaller than JPG, while maintaining the same image quality.
AVIF has a very nice list of advantages:

    "HDR, transparency, and wide color gamut are included.",
    "It provides the highest level of lossless and lossy compression.",
    "Because it was created in a royalty-free format, adoption will be sped up, since developers will not encounter legal or financial obstacles.",
    "Behind it we find companies such as Amazon, Google, Apple, Intel or Samsung, so resources are not in short supply.",

Netflix published images in the AVIF format for the first time in February 2018 and since then, more applications and companies have added support for it, although at a very slow pace. Today, we can find AVIF support in Google Chrome, VLC, and GIMP, and companies like Microsoft are jumping on board. Earlier this year, Netflix published a blog article with objective measurements comparing the image quality and compression efficiency of AVIF to JPEG.

## What is ShortPixel

The team behind Shortpixel have created a free, easy to use, comprehensive, stable, and frequently updated image compression CDN. In addition to the free plan, Shortpixel also offers a plan that is scalable to an unlimited number of image conversions per month. Images are automatically scaled down. Additionally, they provide Cloudflare integration and automated backup solutions.

## ShortPixel supports AVIF

ShortPixel supports AVIF in various ways.

### PHP

A straightforward web interface is offered by ShortPixel Website Optimizer, which can be placed on any PHP website (Magento, Joomla, Drupal, etc.). Your images can be optimized, and WebP and AVIF files can be created on demand.

### CLI

If you do not wish to use a web interface, you can also operate from the command line, and create AVIF and WebP, provided you have PHP installed. Consequently, you can configure ShortPixel to run through cron jobs or other schedulers

### API

A powerful and easy-to-use Reducer API enables customers to access their services with just one call to their API. By using the URL of an image, it is possible to shrink the image. In order to shrink an image via this API, the image must be available online, and you can implement it in any programming language that supports HTTP POST requests.

### Wordpress

A plugin called ShortPixel Image Optimizer (SPIO) allows you to optimize the physical images on your installation. It only works locally, so it physically compresses the images you upload to your website.
