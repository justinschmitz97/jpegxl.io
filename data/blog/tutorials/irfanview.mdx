## What is AVIF

AVIF (AV1 image format) is a new open-source, royalty-free multi-channel image format. Compared with JPEG, PNG, and WebP images, AVIF images offer significantly smaller file sizes and are currently compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Android devices. It is based on the keyframes of the video format AV1, developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) in collaboration with Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org. The AVIF format is already receiving considerable attention, with Netflix stating that it has better image quality and reduced file size than JPEG, PNG, and even WebP formats. AVIF is a fascinating development with the potential to be widely adopted. JPEG has been around for decades, and there is certainly a need for new advanced alternatives.

## What is IrfanView

IrfanView is a free Microsoft Windows program that can be used to view, edit, organize, and convert images. Aside from playing video and audio files, it can also create and paint pictures. A free version of IrfanView is available for non-commercial use; a commercial version must be registered. The program can handle a wide variety of graphic file formats due to its small size, speed, and ease of use. The first release was in 1996.

## IrfanView supports AVIF

IrfanView comes with a bunch of plugins. One of them is the plugin 'Tools', which contains additional functions and features. Especially reading special formats like HEIF and AVIF is supported. However, you will not be able to convert images to the AVIF format. Also, you need to make sure that you have the Windows Extension for AVIF installed. You can find an article about the extension <Link href="/blog/tutorials/windows/" text="in our Windows tutorial"/>.
