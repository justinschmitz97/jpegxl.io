## What is Youtube

YouTube is a free video-sharing website that allows viewers to watch videos online. In addition to watching videos, you can upload your video to the site and share it with others. YouTube was initially created in 2005 and is now the second most popular site, with visitors watching more than 6 billion hours of video each month. The sheer number of videos available on YouTube explains its popularity. Each minute, YouTube receives approximately 100 hours of video content.

Anyone with a computer or mobile device and an internet connection can watch and share YouTube content. YouTube is an excellent resource for everyone, whether you are an individual seeking inspiration or the CEO of an organization with a large budget for video advertising. Though YouTube has a wide range of users, it is viral among younger people who prefer different content, interactive elements, and instant gratification provided by YouTube video content to traditional television. It is used by many people for entertainment purposes, to learn how to do something (tutorials), and to keep up with their favorite artists' latest music videos.

The YouTube platform is accessible in over fifty languages in nearly every country. Google owns YouTube, so all you need to create a YouTube account is a Google account.

## AVIF support

Youtube recommendations say that you have to use a JPG, PNG or GIF file format for your profile picure or video thumbnails.

If you are trying to use an AVIF, it refuses to load the image due to: load the image because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "img-src https: data: android-webview-video-poster:".

Do not get confused, since browsing for an profile picture, modern formats like JXL and AVIF are shown as supported image formats.

There are no public plans whether YouTube will add AVIF support in the future. Since other platforms like Vimeo automatically convert thumbnails to the AVIF format to increase performance and Google is part of the development team behind AVIF, we can expect support in future. Nowadays, YouTube still uses JPG.
