## What is Blogger?

It is an American online content management system that allows for multiuser blogs with time-stamped entries. Pyra Labs developed the system before Google acquired it in 2003. Several blogs are hosted by Google, which can be accessed through a subdomain of blogspot.com. Users can also access blogs from a domain owned by themselves (e.g., www.example.com) by using DNS facilities to direct the domain to Google's servers.

Until May 1, 2010, users could publish blogs and websites to their web hosting servers via FTP via Google Blogger. Such blogs and websites had to be redirected to a blogspot.com subdomain or point their domain to Google's servers through the DNS. Despite its decline in popularity in the United States, Google Blogger has a worldwide user base available in more than 60 languages.

## Blogger AVIF support

To this date, Blogger does not support AVIF. It is uncertain whether support will be added in future.
