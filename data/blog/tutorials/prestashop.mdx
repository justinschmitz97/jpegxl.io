## What is PrestaShop?

PrestaShop offers a self-hosted, open-source e-commerce platform. As a result, it can be downloaded and modified as you wish. A French company launched the solution in 2007.

The PrestaShop platform enables retailers to create and manage online stores free of charge. This is a universal solution that can be scaled up or down to meet the needs of either large or small enterprises. Another aspect of PrestaShop's popularity is its large number of pre-configured features that are adequate for managing an online store. However, suppose a retailer lacks a particular feature. In that case, they will most likely find it in the PrestaShop marketplace that offers an extensive range of free and paid extensions and plugins.

## PrestaShop AVIF support

PrestaShop does not natively support modern image formats like AVIF. However, an extension called 'Squeezeimg' allows conversion to WebP, AVIF, and JP2. The extension enables conversion of 1000 images for free per month, with priced plans for higher needs. The extension currently does not have any customer reviews.
