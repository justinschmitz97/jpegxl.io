## What is JPEG XL?

## What is ImageGlass?

With ImageGlass, you can view images in a lightweight, versatile manner that takes the place of Photo Viewer under Windows 10, 8, 7, and Vista. This is especially useful for users who are experiencing problems displaying PNG and GIF files in Photo Viewer. The program is a simple but powerful application with a simple interface and many essential functions. Thanks to the Magick.NET library, ImageGlass supports a wide range of image formats. As long as Magick.NET is compatible with the desired file type, the user can easily customize the extension list.
