## What is CraftCMS?

The Craft Content Management System was created by Pixel & Tonic in 2013. The software application allows users to create and edit digital content. Craft offers a blank slate for users to work with. The Craft content management system is a platform for developing bespoke websites. You have many options in choosing a CMS, but Craft CMS offers a blank slate that puts your content first. The Craft CMS platform provides developers and content authors with a flexible, tailored experience.

Create custom digital experiences with Craft, a flexible and user-friendly content management system on the web or anywhere else. An intuitive, user-friendly control panel supports content creation and administrative tasks. A GraphQL API is also provided that is automatically generated and can be used to develop headless applications. With a built-in Plugin Store, you have access to hundreds of free and commercial plugins, which can be customized according to your requirements while maintaining a robust framework for module and plugin development.

## CraftCMS AVIF support

AVIF is not supported by CraftCMS. A solution can be found in plugins. Imager X is a Craft plugin for performing image transformations, optimizations, and manipulation. Imager X conducts all of the functions that are usually performed by the built-in functionality. Among the supported formats are WebP, AVIF, JPEG XL, and legacy formats that can be optimized via optimizers like mozjpeg. It is a commercial plugin that can be purchased through the Craft plugin store for $50.
