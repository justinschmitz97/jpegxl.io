## What is AVIF

AV1 Image File Format (AVIF), also known as AV1, is one of the most recently launched image codecs developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM). The main goal of AVIF is to provide you with optimized and smaller images while maintaining the same quality. Unlike Google's WebP image format, which did not attract many supporters, AVIF has rapidly gained the support of many major companies, including Google, Netflix, and Apple. As a matter of fact, Apple and Netflix now contribute directly to the AVIF project.

## What is Netflix

Currently, Netflix operates in nearly every country in the world, and is the world's largest streaming platform for premium media content. Streaming was one of the first players in the industry when it transitioned in 2007, and its gamble has paid off with hundreds of millions of subscribers worldwide. Netflix initially built its streaming service based on licensed content from other distributors. In 2013, Netflix began funding its own original programming. House of Cards was the first of Netflix's new original series, which set a new standard for streaming-only entertainment. There have been significant increases in Netflix's efforts to create original content since then, placing a strain on its relationship with other publishers. In addition, new streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney Plus have grown into serious competitors. Netflix, however, remains the dominant player in the market. Moreover, the Netflix brand has become synonymous with streaming, with phrases such as "Netflix and chill" entering the public lexicon.

## AVIF support

Despite Netflix focusing on streaming video content, it has plenty of images it needs to compress on its content menus across smart TVs, phones, tablets, laptops, and streaming devices connected to televisions.

Netflix is available on various devices - smart TVs, mobile devices, tablets, computers, and streaming devices connected to TV screens. The user interface (UI), designed to browse the product catalog and provide recommendations, is rich in graphics and images across all device categories.

Netflix recently released an update to a new image file format called AVIF, or AV1 Image File Format, which it believes can be a superior replacement for the 27-year-old JPEG specification. Netflix has released the AVIF framework for other developers to evaluate against existing image codecs in terms of performance and compression efficiency.

Netflix has published screenshot comparisons demonstrating the superiority of AVIF over JPEG and other formats across a range of image types that Netflix must be able to display when displaying images of its video content.

You don't have to enable AVIF support manually. If your device supports AVIF, Netflix will display the image to you in this format.
