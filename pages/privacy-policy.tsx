      Hello, you are visiting the Legal Blog and Privacy Policy of jpegxl.io, a
      tool by Justin Schmitz and Niksa Sporin. Most parts of this site are
      created by privacy generators and of course, contain many legal terms. I
      don&apos;t want you to have to read all this, but since you are here, I
      have created this small paragraph to tell you how and which data we use in
      a short and easy to read way. For an imprint, please visit the imprint
      page of https://justinschmitz.de/.
      <Heading level={3} text="Can we see images?" />
      No. We don&apos;t like to store data that doesn&apos;t belong to me, and
      we try to keep it to a minimum. That&apos;s why we only convert images in
      the browser. We use a few technologies so that no images are uploaded
      during the process and we can never simply view your images. There&apos;s
      one exception: if a conversion fails, we&apos;ll immediately ask you if
      you want to send us the image so that we can further evaluate what went
      wrong. Again, we don&apos;t send images without your consent under any
      circumstances. Besides, I really don&apos;t care about your 500 dog
      pictures, I&apos;m sorry.
      <Heading level={3} text="What about analytics?" />
      We use Hotjar and GA. The only reason we use it is because it provides us
      with useful data that allows us to optimize our service. It sounds like an
      empty phrase, but it is certainly true, and I will tell you how. We
      receive data about the most commonly used browsers, devices and
      resolutions. We integrate this information into our testing process. We
      don&apos;t want to send our website advertising to people who aren&apos;t
      interested in it, but to people who can benefit from it. It also allows us
      to evaluate the growth and maybe find an investor for the future.
      It&apos;s probably even good for which countries are our primary targets,
      so we can offer personalized content like translations Cool? Cool.
      What&apos;s special about Hotjar is that we found this tool only recently
      and we absolutely love it. What Hotjar does is that it records your web
      session on our website. That sounds scary at first, but there&apos;s no
      reason to be afraid. We can&apos;t see you through your webcam, nor can we
      see anything else BUT our website. It stores no IP addresses, just your
      country, browser and operating system. Since the day we activated it,
      we&apos;ve added and repaired so many tiny things that have drastically
      improved the overall user experience. After viewing a record of the web
      session, we delete them.
      <Heading
        level={3}
        text="Below is the full version of the privacy policy."
      />
      This is all we are now doing. We could integrate a Rest API or run ads in
      the future. In addition, there could be some kind of payment. In any case,
      we will update the Privacy Policy accordingly, as we have done and want to
      do. If you are interested in reading the Privacy Policy and legal terms
      generated below, do not hesitate. If you would like to answer a simple
      question, please send an e-mail to support@jpegxl.io or just tweet
      @jschmitz97. I will be happy to help and answer any questions you may
      have.

      CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
      websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach
      stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
      United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites
      collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers
      to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
      information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being
      shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at:
      https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/
      According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: (a) users can visit our
      site anonymously; (b) our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”,
      and can easily be found on the page specified above on the home page of
      our website; (c) users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on
      our Privacy Policy Blog; (d) users are able to change their personal
      information by emailing us at support@jpegxl.io. Our Policy on “Do Not
