## Introduction

Those who are interested will find an introduction explaining Vivaldi and JPEG XL
below for SEO purposes. You can jump to the tutorial on <Link

## What is JPEG XL?

JPEG XL is a professional image delivery format that is useful for web photographers and web designers. Additionally, it supports images with a high bit depth in addition to wide color gamuts and high dynamic ranges. Among the many features of JPEG XL are animation, alpha channels, layers, thumbnails, lossless decoding, and progressive decoding.

The image quality and compression ratio of JPEG XL are significantly better than those of legacy JPEG. JPEGs created in the past can be quickly converted to the new format by implementing lossless JPEG recompression.

The JPEG XL format supports lossless and lossy compression. Lossless compression tends to reduce filesizes by 20-60%. Encoding and decoding can be computationally efficient using software implementations.

## What is Vivaldi?

Vivaldi is a freeware, cross-platform web browser developed by Vivaldi Technologies, founded by former Opera CEO and co-founder Tatsuki Tomita. On April 6, 2016, Vivaldi was officially launched.

The program is intended to be used by anyone. Still, its primary audience is technical users who might have been disgruntled by Opera's switch from its Presto layout engine to a Chromium-based browser. Even though Vivaldi is also based on Chrome, it aims to revive the features of the Presto-based Opera.

Vivaldi has more than 2.3 million active users as of September 2021.

## What are Vivaldi Flags?

Flags represent Vivaldi features that are currently being developed. Those can be found in the hidden settings menu accessible from the navigation bar. A flag must be set for JPEG XL, so the functionality is disabled by default. It is not known when Vivaldi's default behavior will include JPEG XL support.

## Vivaldi JPEG XL Tutorial

- Ensure you have at least Vivaldi version installed.
- Open a new browser tab.
- Type the following: _vivaldi://flags#enable-jxl_
- The first and marked result shows an entry called _Enable JXL image_ format with the description _Adds image decoding support for the JPEG XL image format. Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, Android_ and the hashtag _#enable-jxl_.
- On the right, click the drop-down menu and select _Enable_ to enable the support. After completing the process, you will be prompted to restart your web browser for the changes to take effect.
