## What is ImageGlass?

Under Windows 10, 8, 7, and Vista, ImageGlass lets you view images in a lightweight, versatile way, which replaces Photo Viewer. Those who have trouble viewing PNG or GIF files in Photo Viewer will significantly benefit from this. With a simple interface and many essential features, the application is simple but powerful. ImageGlass offers a wide range of image formats thanks to the Magick.NET library. The user can easily customize the list of extensions as long as Magick.NET supports the desired file type.

## ImageGlass JPEG XL Support

As ImageGlass uses Magick.NET for its image codecs, and Magick.NET supports JPEG XL, the integration was easy! Version 8.1.4.18 was released on April 17th, 2021, and supports JPEG XL. JXL images can be opened like any other image.
