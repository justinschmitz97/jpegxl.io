## What is GIMP?

GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free and open-source graphics editor. Though it was initially developed as a Linux image editor, it has evolved into a powerful alternative to Adobe Photoshop while remaining accessible and open source.

GIMP is capable of reading WebP files and has recently added support for the new image format AVIF.

## GIMP JXL Support

To this date, Gimp does not have native JPEG XL support in a release version. The development version 2.99 features JPEG XL support in the win64-nightly release.

Several plugins exist that claim to add JPEG XL support. However, we didn't find a plugin that was fully working, responsive, or easy to install for a regular end user during our testing.

If you're nerdy and would like to dive deeper into the topic, we recommend the following:
